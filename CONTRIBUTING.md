# How to file a bug report
Create a new issue with as much description of the problem as possible. Include steps needed for reproduction if the bug is not obvious.
It's also possible to submit bug reports anonymously to my [feedback form](http://klocmansoftware.weebly.com/feedback--contact.html).

# How to suggest a new feature
The same as bug report. Well-explained suggestions are preferred.

# How to donate
Check [README.md](README.md) or main window of BCUninstaller for the donate link. Only donate using the official donate links.

# How to help translate
Translations are stored in .resx files (almost all except for Resources.resx). It's suggested to use the [ResxTranslator](https://github.com/HakanL/resxtranslator) to translate these files. It will save you a lot of work. Most if not all of translators here use it.

You can translate by creating a branch, translating it, and then starting a pull request. If you are not familiar with git and GitHub, you can ask for a translation pack through my [feedback form](http://klocmansoftware.weebly.com/feedback--contact.html). It will contain everything needed. Once done, simply send it back to my mail.

# How to set up your environment and run tests
Any modern version of Visual Studio should work. You might need to download download [this](https://github.com/Klocman/UpdateSystem) and [this library](https://sourceforge.net/p/kloctoolslibrary/) separately. 
Tests use the test framework included in new Visual Studio versions. Some of the tests require running as 64bit to pass, or some specific applications to be installed.
